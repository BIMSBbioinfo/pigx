* Subtrees

This repository includes the pipeline repositories as git subtrees.  The following commands were used to add them:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
for pipeline in bsseq rnaseq chipseq crispr scrnaseq; do
  git remote add $pipeline git@github.com:BIMSBbioinfo/pigx_$pipeline.git
  git subtree add --prefix=pipelines/$pipeline/ $pipeline master
done
#+END_SRC

To update all subtrees run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
for pipeline in bsseq rnaseq chipseq crispr scrnaseq; do
  git subtree pull --prefix=pipelines/$pipeline/ $pipeline master
done
#+END_SRC
