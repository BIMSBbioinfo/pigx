## Download

First clone the upstream repository from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/pigx_chipseq.git --recursive
```

## Configure

PiGx uses the GNU build system.  Developers need to bootstrap the
build system first with the `bootstrap.sh` script.  Bootstrapping
requires GNU Autoconf and GNU Automake.

```
cd pigx_chipseq
./bootstrap.sh
```

Bootstrapping creates the `configure` script, a portable shell script.
You need to run the script to configure the package before building.
The configure script will check for all required dependencies, 
so make sure you have them set up with guix or using any other package manager.
Assuming you have Guix installed, the following command spawns a
sub-shell in which all dependencies are available:

```
guix environment -l guix.scm
```

**IMPORTANT**: The default prefix (path to where tools are installed
to) for installation will be `/usr/local/`, so if you do not have
permissions to write to this location (i.e. do not have root
permission) then just use a different location like a subdirectory
under `$HOME`.

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/pigx

NOTE: The configure has multiple options, you can see a description using:

```
./configure --help
```

For example, the following command overrides the locations of the
executables for `R`, `Rscript`, and `samtools`, disables checks for
required R packages, and configures the package to be installed in the
current directory:

```
./configure --disable-r-packages-check  \
            R=$HOME/programs/R-3.4.1/bin/R \
            RSCRIPT=$HOME/programs/R-3.4.1/bin/Rscript \
            SAMTOOLS=$HOME/.guix-profile/bin/samtools \
            --prefix=$PWD
```

Be aware that `--disable-r-packages-check` should only be used when
you are certain that all R packages are available at runtime.  It
should not be used when installing the pipeline to a shared location
for all users.

## Building

Even if you don't choose to install the pipeline, you will still need
to build a couple of files.  Do that by running `make`.

If you want to skip the installation step, you will need to set the
environment variable `PIGX_UNINSTALLED` to any value before running
the executable from the current working directory.

```
export PIGX_UNINSTALLED=1
```

Now finally you can call the executable:

```
./pigx-chipseq Tests/sample_sheet.yaml -s Tests/settings.yaml
```

and you should see the flying pig. :)


## Install

In order to properly set up the packages structure under the prefix
location run:

```
make install
```


## Releases

Releases are made by the core developers only.  This section describes
the release process.

- Any new release tarball should have a unique version number.  This
  is achieved by updating the version string in the `VERSION` file.

- Run the tests and build a new tarball.  Since we are using
  Autotools, we can run the test suite and generate a new release
  tarball with  `make distcheck`.

> NOTE: You will find the output of the check in the installation
> directory ($PREFIX ) under `pigx_chipseq-0.0.1/_build/test-suite.log`.

- Once the tests pass and you are sure to make the release, create a
  new signed tag with `git tag --sign v$(cat VERSION)`.

- Sign the release tarball with GPG to create a detached signature.

- Push the tag to Github, and then upload the tarball and the detached
  signature to https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/pigx_chipseq/releases


## Conventions

- use the `shell` block to execute scripts.  We cannot use Snakemake's
  `script` block, because that assumes that the directory containing
  the scripts is writable.

- use `nice` to run tools inside a `shell` block.  `nice` expects a
  tool name and a list of tool arguments.  Optionally, you can provide
  a third argument to specify a log file to which all output is
  redirected.

- to reference a tool outside of a `shell` block, do not access
  `config` directly, but use the helper `tool`.

- to print messages use the `fmt` helper, which ensures that messages
  all have the same style.
