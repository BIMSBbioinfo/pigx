## Download

First clone the upstream repository from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/pigx_bsseq.git
```

## Configure

PiGx uses the GNU build system.  Developers need to bootstrap the
build system first with the `bootstrap.sh` script.  Bootstrapping
requires GNU Autoconf and GNU Automake.

```
./bootstrap.sh
```

Bootstrapping creates the `configure` script, a portable shell script.
You need to run the script to configure the package before building.

**IMPORTANT**: The default prefix (path to where tools are installed
to) for installation will be `/usr/local/`, so if you do not have
permissions to write to this location (i.e. do not have root
permission) then just use a different location like a subdirectory
under `$HOME`.

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/pigx

NOTE: The configure has multiple options, you can see a description using:

```
./configure --help
```

For example, the following command overrides the locations of the
executables for `R`, `Rscript`, and `samtools`, disables checks for
required R packages, and configures the package to be installed in the
current directory:

```
./configure --disable-r-packages-check  \
            R=$HOME/programs/R-3.4.1/bin/R \
            RSCRIPT=$HOME/programs/R-3.4.1/bin/Rscript \
            SAMTOOLS=$HOME/.guix-profile/bin/samtools \
            --prefix=$PWD
```

Be aware that `--disable-r-packages-check` should only be used when
you are certain that all R packages are available at runtime.  It
should not be used when installing the pipeline to a shared location
for all users.


## Install

In order to properly set up the packages structure under the prefix location type:
```
make install
```

Now finally we can call the executable:
```
$prefix/bin/pigx-bsseq test/samplesheet.csv
```

and we should see the flying pig. :)

You may also skip the installation step.  In that case you will need
to set the environment variable `PIGX_BSSEQ_UNINSTALLED` to any value
before running the executable from the current working directory.


## Releases

Before releasing anything make sure that our test works fine:
```
make check
```

> NOTE: You will find the output of the check in the installation directory ($PREFIX ) under `pigx_bsseq-0.0.1/_build/test-suite.log` .

If this passes without any complains feel free to create a tarball for releasing our package:
```
make dist
```
