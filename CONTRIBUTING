## Download

First clone the directory from the GitHub repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/pigx_bsseq.git
```

## Configure

In order to check for all dependencies, first bootstrap and configure:

```
./bootstrap && ./configure
```

IMPORTANT: The default prefix (path to where tools are installed to) for installation will be `/usr/local/`, so if you do not have permissions to write to this location (i.e. do not have sudo rights) then just use a different location like a subdirectory in your home (has to be absolute path).
```
./configure --prefix=$HOME/pigx
```

> NOTE: The configure has multiple options, you can see a description using:
> ```
> ./configure --help
> ```
> For example If you like to change the  R installation to use and skip checks for required packages:
> ```
> ./configure --disable-r-packages-check  R=$HOME/programs/R-3.4.1/bin/R RSCRIPT=$HOME/programs/R-3.4.1/bin/Rscript SAMTOOLS=$HOME/.guix-profile/bin/samtools --prefix=$PWD
> ```
> but be aware that with `--disable-r-packages-check`, you cannot be sure to have all R packages available on runtime.

## Install

In order to properly set up the packages structure under the prefix location type:
```
make install
```

Now finally we can call the executable:
```
./bin/pigx-bsseq test/Tablesheet.txt
```

and we should see the flying pig. :)


## Releases

Before releasing anything make sure that our test works fine:
```
make check
```

> NOTE: You will find the output of the check in the installation directory ($PREFIX ) under `pigx_bsseq-0.0.1/_build/test-suite.log` .

If this passes without any complains feel free to create a tarball for releasing our package:
```
make dist
```
