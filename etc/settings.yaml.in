#organism is needed for GO term analysis. Leave it empty if not interested in GO analysis.

#DEanalyses:
  #names of analyses can be anything but they have to be unique for each combination of case control group comparisons.
  #analysis1:
    #if multiple sample names is provided, they must be separated by comma
   # case_sample_groups: "HBR"
    #control_sample_groups: "UHR"
    # comma separated list of additional co-variates to control for in differential expression analysis (e.g. batch, age, temperature, sequencing_technology etc.). Must correspond to a column field in the sample_sheet.csv file.)

# Configuration for how to do read counting
# using GenomicAlignments::summarizeOverlaps
# feature type and grouping features must match what is available in the GTF file
# most GTF files will use "exon" or "CDS" as features and "gene_id", and "transcript_id"
# for combining features.
counting:
  counting_mode: "Union" # other options are "IntersectionStrict" and "IntersectionNotEmpty"
  count_nonunique: TRUE # boolean (see inter.feature argument of summarizeOverlaps)
  strandedness: "unspecific" # other options are "forward" and "reverse" for strand-specific read-counting
  feature: "exon"
  group_feature_by: "gene_id"
  yield_size: 2000000 # how many reads to process at a time (this impacts memory consumption)
