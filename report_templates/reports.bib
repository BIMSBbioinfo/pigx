	abstract = {Summary: A combination of bisulfite treatment of {DNA} and high-throughput sequencing ({BS}-Seq) can capture a snapshot of a cell's epigenomic state by revealing its genome-wide cytosine methylation at single base resolution. Bismark is a flexible tool for the time-efficient analysis of {BS}-Seq data which performs both read mapping and methylation calling in a single convenient step. Its output discriminates between cytosines in {CpG}, {CHG} and {CHH} context and enables bench scientists to visualize and interpret their methylation data soon after the sequencing run is completed., Availability and implementation: Bismark is released under the {GNU} {GPLv}3+ licence.
