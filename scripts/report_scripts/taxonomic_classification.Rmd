# Classification of unaligned reads

In order to check the sample and alignment quality the unaligned reads are analysed with the
[Kraken2 taxonomic sequence classification system](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2)
against the [database PlusPFP](https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/k2).
This report is an overview over the species found. It provides insight about possible biases and contamination of the 
samples. In case of abundance of species very similar to SARS-CoV-2 only the taxonomic family will be reported
which could indicate that an identification/alignment of SARS-CoV-2 could be biased or impossible. In case of a high 
percentage of read matching SARS-CoV-2 a refining of trimming parameters should be considered. 

The table below lists all the species found.

* Column explanation:
  + **Percentage** of fragments covered by the clade rooted at this taxon
  + **Number of fragments** covered by the clade rooted at this taxon
  + Number of fragments assigned directly to this taxon
  + **A rank code**, indicating **U**nclassified, **R**oot, **D**omain,
    **K**ingdom, **P**hylum, **C**lass, **O**rder, **F**amily,
    **G**enus, or **S**pecies.  Taxa that are not at any of these 10
    ranks have a rank code that is formed by using the rank code of
    the closest ancestor rank with a number indicating the distance
    from that rank. E.g., "G2" is a rank code indicating a taxon is
    between genus and species and the grandparent taxon is at the
    genus rank.
  + NCBI taxonomic ID number
  + Taxonomic class

# Visualization of taxonomic abundance

This interactive multi-layered pie chart shows the proportions of the classified taxons shown in the table above which 
were found by *Kraken 2*. It was created using [KronaTools](https://github.com/marbl/Krona/wiki).
