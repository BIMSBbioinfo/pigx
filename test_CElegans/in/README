Test fastq files for ce10: Single End (SE) and paired-end (PE) test cases are ostensibly independent, even through the data for the former is actually copied from one of the latter files.
The unorthodox paired-end naming ("-A", "-B") is chosen to illustrate the robostness of the pipelines input. Arbitrary filenames can be supplied, and the file-links generated by the program itself will be made to conform to the standard "{sample}_1, {sample}_2" pattern.
