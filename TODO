TODO 
=====

- remove GTOOLBOX variable  (RW) 
 	? cleaner to have config["progs"][XY] storing absolute path of tool, 
 	  since not all tools need to be located in the same dir
 	  + autoconf will replace placeholder with absolute paths anyways

- add rules for differential methylation and create a html report for that (KW)

- update html generation so that the pigx logo is above the table of contents browser (AG)

- update README.md :  provide description of the tablesheet input and layout (BO) 

- update Tablsheet inputs to have color-coded boxes, etc. (BO)

==== update ====
- update test procedure (automated)

- Add warning to config.parsing to let user know that the config file will not be re-generated if it already exists. (AG)
 (in argument_parsing branch)

- Add options to handle bam file inputs (skipping trimming, alignment, etc. and going straight to methylation calling)

- add symbolic links to files to account for different extensions/names (e.g. *.fq.gz vs. *.fastq.ga ...) (BO)

- add separation to the tablsheet input (obvious parameters for biologists vs. highly technical input parameters)
