TODO 
=====

- remove GTOOLBOX variable 
 	? cleaner to have config["progs"][XY] storing absolute path of tool, 
 	  since not all tools need to be located in the same dir
 	  + autoconf will replace placeholder with absolute paths anyways

- restructure pipeline to extract methylation calls using methylKit
	? faster than bismark_methylation_extractor

- replace fixed folder names with variables, to allow easy changing

- integrate paring CSV table and converting it to a yaml config file
- add rules for differential methylation and create a html report for that
