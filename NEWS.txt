   [*]. bigWig files for selected cells
   [*]. Add fastqc

171206:
    - working pipeline




To Do:

[]. Gene count matrix
[]. Read statistics with dropbeat
[]. manual parameters



[]. indrop parser
[]. File order for read_dropseq is hardcoded - change this
[]. Downstream analysis:
    - normalization
    - imputation
    - clustering
    - cell types
    - visualization
    - tsne
    - pseudotime inference
    - diffusion maps
[]. set report to relative path


Indrop index specification:
indrop UMI description:
sequence W1 adapter: AAGGCGTCACAAGCAATCACTC

B1 anatomy: BBBBBBBB[BBB]WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWCCCCCCCCUUUUUUTTTTTTTTTT______________
B = Barcode1, can be 8, 9, 10 or 11 bases long.
W = 'W1' sequence, specified below
C = Barcode2, always 8 bases
U = UMI, always 6 bases
T = Beginning of polyT tail.
_ = Either sequencing survives across the polyT tail, or signal starts dropping off
(and start being anything, likely with poor quality)
minimal_polyT_len_on_R1 = 7
hamming_threshold_for_W1_matching = 3
w1 = "GAGTGATTGCTTGTGACGCCTT"
rev_w1 = "AAGGCGTCACAAGCAATCACTC" #Hard-code so we don't recompute on every one of millions of calls


Tests:
    - gtf tests:
        - check for gene_id and gene_name columns in gtf


ADDITIONAL WORK:

* scRNA_report - dependency on the get_umi_matrix must be set
* Create rules for making all of the annotation
* The rmarkdown document needs to be updated for the experiment selection
* sort out the getfiles function to be unambiguous
* write checks for data structures
