## Download

First clone the upstream repository from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/pigx_bsseq.git
```

## Configure

PiGx uses the GNU build system.  Developers need to bootstrap the
build system first with the `bootstrap.sh` script.  Bootstrapping
requires GNU Autoconf and GNU Automake.

```
./bootstrap.sh
```

Bootstrapping creates the `configure` script, a portable shell script.
You need to run the script to configure the package before building.

**IMPORTANT**: The default prefix (path to where tools are installed
to) for installation will be `/usr/local/`, so if you do not have
permissions to write to this location (i.e. do not have root
permission) then just use a different location like a subdirectory
under `$HOME`.

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/pigx

NOTE: The configure has multiple options, you can see a description using:

```
./configure --help
```

For example, the following command overrides the locations of the
executables for `R`, `Rscript`, and `samtools`, disables checks for
required R packages, and configures the package to be installed in the
current directory:

```
./configure --disable-r-packages-check  \
            R=$HOME/programs/R-3.4.1/bin/R \
            RSCRIPT=$HOME/programs/R-3.4.1/bin/Rscript \
            SAMTOOLS=$HOME/.guix-profile/bin/samtools \
            --prefix=$PWD
```

Be aware that `--disable-r-packages-check` should only be used when
you are certain that all R packages are available at runtime.  It
should not be used when installing the pipeline to a shared location
for all users.

## Building

Even if you don't choose to install the pipeline, you will still need
to build a couple of files.  Do that by running `make`.

## Install

In order to properly set up the packages structure under the prefix location type:
```
make install
```

Now finally we can call the executable:
```
$prefix/bin/pigx-bsseq test/sample_sheet.csv
```

and we should see the flying pig. :)

You may also skip the installation step.  In that case you will need
to set the environment variable `PIGX_UNINSTALLED` to any value
before running the executable from the current working directory.


## Releases

Releases are made by the core developers only.  This section describes
the release process.

- Any new release tarball should have a unique version number.  This
  is achieved by updating the version string in the `VERSION` file.

- Run the tests and build a new tarball.  Since we are using
  Autotools, we can run the test suite and generate a new release
  tarball with  `make distcheck`.

> NOTE: You will find the output of the check in the installation
> directory ($PREFIX ) under `pigx_bsseq-0.0.1/_build/test-suite.log`.

- Once the tests pass and you are sure to make the release, create a
  new signed tag with `git tag --sign v$(cat VERSION)`.

- Sign the release tarball with GPG to create a detached signature.

- Push the tag to Github, and then upload the tarball and the detached
  signature to https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/pigx_bsseq/releases


## Conventions

- use the `shell` block to execute scripts.  We cannot use Snakemake's
  `script` block, because that assumes that the directory containing
  the scripts is writable.

- use `nice` to run tools inside a `shell` block.  `nice` expects a
  tool name and a list of tool arguments.  Optionally, you can provide
  a third argument to specify a log file to which all output is
  redirected.

- to reference a tool outside of a `shell` block, do not access
  `config` directly, but use the helper `tool`.

- to print messages use the `fmt` helper, which ensures that messages
  all have the same style.
