This directory contains working data used by the pigx pipeline
(primarily file links). It is normally not necessary for users to look
in this directory, however it can be used to provide traceability (in
case the user has run the pipeline and forgotten e.g., which input
files were used, etc.).

For example: the directory "input/" contains a set of links that point
to the locations of the original data that are fed into the
pipeline. The pipeline itself operates on these 'links' and by
checking this directory, one can identify the names and locations of
the source files that were used to produce the output. Note that the
file extensions are standardized to always terminate in ".fq.gz", even
if the original data used the extension ".fastq.gz".

Likewise, the link "refGenome" points to the directory in which the
reference genome is stored.

The directory "bin" stores links to various programs used in the
pipeline's execution.
